Installation on a local computer
==================================

Installing KENV
------------------

The installation requires the `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__.

**Installation steps**:

-  Install ``kenv``

   ::
       pip install kenv

   Alternatively, instead of using ``pip``, you can also install KENV
   from the souces, by cloning the `code from Github <https://github.com/fuodorov/kenv>`_, and typing ``python setup.py install``.


-  **Optional:** To be able to run interactive simulations, write text and mathematical formulas at the same time, install the optional package ``jupyterlab'' ::

   ::
       pip install jupyterlab


-  **Optional:** We recommend installing all additional packages from the `<requirements <https://github.com/fuodorov/kenv/blob/master/requirements.txt>`:

   ::

      pip install -r requirements
